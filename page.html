          <span>Hey Arpita,</span>
          <br />
          On this Rose Day, I just wanted to share something. ðŸŒ¹  
          Each petal of a rose reminds me of how amazing you are and how much your presence brightens my world. Like a rose in full bloom, you have this way of being effortlessly beautiful, inside and out.  
          
          The red roses? They reflect all the good vibes and energy you bring. The white ones? Theyâ€™re for how genuine and pure your friendship feels. In this random little garden of life, youâ€™re one of the most special people Iâ€™ve met.  
          
          Thanks for being so cool and inspiring in your own way. Happy Rose Day, Arpita! Hereâ€™s to more shared laughs, fun moments, and memories weâ€™ll keep adding to!
